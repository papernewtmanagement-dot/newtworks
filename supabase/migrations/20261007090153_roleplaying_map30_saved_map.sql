--   deep       map_swim_depth (1.2 m, chest-deep: it is swum), else water (it is waded). Water lies over places
--              and every ground; the cell keeps its place (place_id) so a river in the Old Forest is in it.
--   place      its center lies inside a place card with ground of its own (a movement penalty), by the natural
--              edge of that place (rpg_map_within); place_id = the smallest such card. A place fills cells of a
--              grid when its oval covers the center of the cell its own center falls in; only places that fill
--              are ground.
--   town       its center lies inside a village, town or city (rpg_map_town_cells; step 8): their streets and
--              yards. Only the City grid and finer: a coarser grid marks them instead (rpg_map_view_block).
--   road       the battle grid only: a highway, road or lane runs over the square (rpg_map_road_cells; step 8b), the
--   pass       middle of the square within half the width of the road from its line: road, or pass where the ground under
--              it is mountains (a road over a pass keeps its climb). A road over snow and ice is the snow and ice; where
--              a road meets a river or a lake it crosses it: by a bridge (road, ahead of the water) or, where the
--              stretch fords that river (step 11; rpg_map_ford_cells), through the water, which is knee-deep there
--              (water, waded); the sea stops it. Coarser grids draw roads as lines instead.
--   the land  everything else: the ground the land makes (rpg_map_nature): sea, mountains, hills, forest, open
--              land, then woods, clearings and rough ground, then the climates. The battle grid reads it at every
--              square. Every coarser grid reads it from the grid under it (step 9, Peter 2026-10-04): 9 points in each
--              cell, three across and three down a third of a cell apart, read with the layers down to the next grid;
--              the cell takes the ground most of them hold (a tie goes to the ground nearer the middle of the cell).
--              So the coast, the chains, the woods and the climates of a coarse cell are what most of the ground under
--              it is, and zooming in keeps the borders in place, only finer.
-- A place with no movement penalty (a continent, a country) only names the land and never changes a cell.
-- marks = the places with ground that reach into a land cell but are too small or too thin to fill any cell of
-- this grid, smallest first: a village in a 1.2-mile cell, a road 29 feet wide crossing it. Only the places this
-- grid is about are marked: the kind it lists (place_level one below the grid) and every bigger kind. A city is
-- not marked on a Country grid; it shows from the Region grid down.

-- the middle of this grid (for a place shown whole, the lands above it that hold its middle), biggest first (only
-- places that name the land, the smallest of each kind), grounds = each kind of unnamed ground with its name and
-- its range in words (rpg_map_band_text), and the ladder of grids in words.
-- The world and a place shown whole also carry detail: every cell of the grid one level down inside the block (for
-- the world, the Continent grids: 144 across and 72 down), one character a cell (the letter of its ground in
-- rpg_map_grounds: ~ sea, . open land, t forest and so on; else the character numbered 256 + the place's spot in
-- detail.places, counted from 0), so they
-- are drawn as fine as the grids inside them; wrap = the east edge of the drawing meets its west edge (the world
-- only); marks = the smaller places reaching into a cell of the detail, by its "x,y" counted from 0 at the top-left
-- corner, the same as the marks of a cell.
-- Each cell also carries to = the world square at its middle (counted from 1, as pieces stand), where a piece walks or is placed when
-- the cell is tapped; cost = the percent of time a square of it adds to cross it (rpg_map_costs; the average square of
-- its ground on a grid coarser than the City grid); hard = 0 to 9, how far up its ground's range it sits, drawn darker
-- the higher (nothing coarser than the City grid). A grid drawn fine carries hard too, one digit a cell of the detail
-- (- for none). river = the biggest river drawn as a line through a cell too coarse to hold it as water (2 a great
-- river, 3 a river, 4 a stream, 5 a brook; rpg_map_rivers) with the point its line passes nearest the cell's middle,
-- in thousandths of a cell from that middle, so the line is drawn where the river truly runs at every zoom; the detail
-- carries rivers, one digit a cell (0 none), and river_x, river_y, that point as a digit 0 to 9 across the cell.
-- journey = the open journey, if any (a session played on the world map): its clock in words,
-- whose turn it is, its last lines of log, every piece (where it stands on this grid in thousandths of a cell like a
-- place spot, the cell name, the grid of this zoom that holds it, when its next turn comes, what is left of its walking day, the
-- square it is heading for and how far that is; for a creature met in its haunt whether it is out of the fight; and
-- whether the piece is in a fight, rpg_map_in_fight) and the characters that can still join. Under the ground (step
-- 12d2) a piece carries under = where it is in words (rpg_map_under_where); the piece whose turn it is carries ways =
-- its ways on, each [node, words] (rpg_map_under_ways, rpg_map_under_way_words; partway along a passage: on, or back),
-- mouth = it can come up here, search = it can search here for the ways up; on the surface, cave = the name of the cave
-- or mine it stands at and can go into (rpg_map_under_cave_at).
-- towns = the villages, towns and cities the read shows (step 8; rpg_map_towns): the Continent grid its great cities
-- (step 12a), the Country grid its cities and great cities and the Region grid all of them, each a mark in the cell its middle stands in (its id among the marks of that cell); on the City
-- grid and finer the cells of the ground of each (rpg_map_town_cells), which come as kind place with place = its id,
-- so they are drawn and named like a place with ground. A grid drawn fine carries them in its detail the same way.
-- Each is told as rpg_map_town_entry tells it; the Region grid lists its towns, cities and great cities.
-- roads = the roads the read draws (step 8b; rpg_map_roads): highways from the Country grid down, roads and lanes from
-- the Region grid down to the District grid (a place shown whole draws those of the grid of its detail; the battle grid has
-- them as ground of its own, road and mountain road, among its cells). Each piece of road is [size (1 highway, 2 road,
-- 3 lane), x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, ...] in thousandths of a cell from the top-left corner: the points of the wandering
-- line of a stretch (step 10b; rpg_map_road_lines, read at the cell drawn, a point every half cell at least), cut where
-- it leaves the cells that are found and not sea (a road crosses rivers and lakes, by a bridge, a ford or a ferry); the
-- page draws each piece as one smooth line through its points. road_width = how wide each size is, in thousandths of a
-- cell of what is drawn.
-- crossings = where the roads cross the rivers, and the fords off the roads (step 11, Peter 2026-10-04: bridges and
-- fords), from the Region grid down to the District grid, each [kind (1 a bridge, 2 a ford where a road crosses, 3 a
-- planned ford off the roads), river (2 a great river, 3 a river, 4 a stream), road (1 highway, 2 road, 3 lane; 0 for
-- a planned ford), x, y (thousandths of a cell from the top-left corner), angle (degrees, the way across the water,
-- clockwise from east), span (the width of the water there, thousandths of a cell)]: a stretch of road crosses a
-- river by a bridge or a ford as rpg_map_crossing_kind rolls for it, the same at every zoom; a planned ford lies where
-- rpg_map_fords puts it (rivers from the City grid down, streams from the District grid down). The battle grid shows
-- them as ground instead: a cell carries cross = bridge (road ground over water) or ford (knee-deep water a road or a
-- planned ford makes; rpg_map_ford_cells), so the page draws planks or a stony shallow.
-- houses = the houses on the battle grid (step 8c; rpg_map_buildings): each its id, roof (thatch or tile), its middle
-- (x, y in thousandths of a square from the top-left corner), the way its ridge runs ([x, y], thousandths of a step),
-- its length and width (thousandths of a square), its height to the eaves in metres, its roof's pitch in degrees and its
-- storeys. A cell a house stands on carries climb = [wall or roof, metres it climbs, degrees, difficulty of the Climbing
-- roll, what it is in words] (rpg_map_building_cells, rpg_map_climb_words); its cost is the climb's. A landmark stands on
-- the battle grid the same way (step 12b2): each square of its walls, stones or mound carries its climb, part the kind
-- of square (keep, curtain, tower, ruin, stone, boulder, cairn, mound). The kids login sees a house once a cell of it is found.
-- A place to go into stands the same way (step 12c: hut, shrine, cross, outcrop, spoil, palisade, tent), and a square of
-- it walked like the ground carries feature = what it is (floor, hearth, altar, or mouth: the way into a cave or a mine).
-- landmarks = the landmarks the read shows (step 12b; rpg_map_landmarks), from the World grid down to the District grid:
-- each grid those of its own rank and every rank above it, few on the world and more each level down (Peter
-- 2026-10-03 17:28), each a mark in the cell its middle stands in (its id among the marks of that cell; a grid drawn
-- fine carries it in the marks of its detail), told as rpg_map_landmark_entry tells it. The kids login sees a
-- landmark when its cell is found or known, or from as far off as it can be made out (rpg_map_landmark_sight) of where
-- a player character walked, since things seen and steered by from far are what landmarks are (Peter 2026-10-06): a
-- landmark seen that way is marked even in a cell not found yet. The battle grid has none here.
-- under = the world under the ground (step 12d; rpg_map_underground), from the Continent grid down to the District grid:
-- lines = its passages, each [kind (deep, cave, shaft, own, join, delve), from x, y, to x, y (thousandths of a cell from
-- the top-left corner of the block, either end may lie off it), metres down at each end, bend (hundredths of a quarter
-- of its length to one side)]; halls = the great halls of the Deeps in the block, each [name, x, y, metres down]. The
-- game master sees all of it; the kids login only the own passage of a cave or mine in a cell found or known.
-- On the battle grid (step 12d3) under = the battle grid under the ground instead: squares = every open square under the
-- block (rpg_map_under_squares), each [column, row (from the top-left corner of the block), part (floor, rubble, pool,
-- column, shaft), percent of time it adds (none: no way in), water metres deep, feet down], of the passages and rooms
-- of the Deeps and cave country under the block (rpg_map_underground) and of those round each piece under the ground
-- within 40 squares of it (rpg_map_under_layer: so the passage of a cave or a mine shows where a piece is in it);
-- every other square under it is solid rock. The kids login sees those the group knows, and those round its own pieces.
-- The kids login sees the same read, cut to what the group has found (Peter 2026-10-03, 2A: within sight of where a
-- piece walked, rpg_map_found) or knows (1A: Knowing a place at 1 or more shows all of it, rpg_map_known_places):
-- other cells come as kind unknown with no place, places and lands only once found or known, a place lore only once
-- known, creatures only within sight of a character, and nothing to add.
-- The page draws these as given and works nothing out itself.
